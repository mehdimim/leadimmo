Villas with 4+ bedrooms and hotel-grade services can sustain 8-10% gross yield.</p><h2>East Coast lifestyle</h2><p>Chaweng Noi remains the lifestyle magnet for digital nomads. Renovated villas with smart-home upgrades and wellness spaces lead absorption.</p><h2>South Coast serenity</h2><p>Laem Sor and Taling Ngam are emerging for ultra-private compounds.
